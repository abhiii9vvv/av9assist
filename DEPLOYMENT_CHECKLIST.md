## ❌ Why Vercel Fails: Environment Variables Missing

The ONLY reason it fails on Vercel is that **environment variables aren't set in Vercel dashboard**.

---

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE FIX (Takes 2 Minutes):

### Step 1: Open Your Vercel Dashboard
```
https://vercel.com/dashboard
```

### Step 2: Select Your Project
Click on **av9assist** project

### Step 3: Go to Settings → Environment Variables
```
Project → Settings → Environment Variables
```

### Step 4: Add These Variables (ONE BY ONE):

**Variable 1:**
```
Name: GOOGLE_API_KEY
Value: AIzaSyBGviJ9TaBp9k7QmKthlW_q8j8V_aq7OP4
Environment: ✅ Production ✅ Preview
```

**Variable 2:**
```
Name: GOOGLE_API_KEY_2
Value: AIzaSyCCN4sEZUi8Y7zDNWWgcSaoub-oJnWrQIA
Environment: ✅ Production ✅ Preview
```

**Variable 3:**
```
Name: GOOGLE_MODEL
Value: gemini-2.5-flash
Environment: ✅ Production ✅ Preview
```

**Variable 4:**
```
Name: SAMBANOVA_API_KEY
Value: 754cb146-2b0a-44e8-9bc6-e1ad7db33ded
Environment: ✅ Production ✅ Preview
```

**Variable 5:**
```
Name: SAMBANOVA_MODEL
Value: Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct
Environment: ✅ Production ✅ Preview
```

**Variable 6:**
```
Name: OPENROUTER_API_KEY
Value: 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
Environment: ✅ Production ✅ Preview
```

**Variable 7:**
```
Name: OPENROUTER_MODEL
Value: meta-llama/llama-3.3-8b-instruct:free
Environment: ✅ Production ✅ Preview
```

**Variable 8:**
```
Name: PROVIDERS_ORDER
Value: gemini,sambanova,openrouter
Environment: ✅ Production ✅ Preview
```

### Step 5: Redeploy

After adding all variables, click **Redeploy** in Vercel dashboard OR run:
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger vercel redeploy"
git push
```

## 🔍 Verify It's Fixed:

### Check 1: Diagnostic Endpoint
Visit: `https://your-site.vercel.app/api/env-check`

Should show:
```json
{
  "GOOGLE_API_KEY": "AIzaSyBGvi...",
  "GOOGLE_API_KEY_2": "AIzaSyCCN4...",
  "GOOGLE_MODEL": "gemini-2.5-flash",
  ...
}
```

**NOT:**
```json
{
  "GOOGLE_API_KEY": "❌ NOT SET",
  ...
}
```

### Check 2: Test the Chat
1. Go to `https://your-site.vercel.app/chat`
2. Send a message: "Hello"
3. Should get AI response ✅

### Check 3: Test Image Upload
1. Upload an image
2. Should work within 10-15 seconds ✅

---

## 🎯 Common Mistakes:

### ❌ Mistake 1: Typo in Variable Names
- Must be exactly: `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (not `GOOGLE_APIKEY`)
- Must be exactly: `GOOGLE_API_KEY_2` (not `GOOGLE_API_KEY2`)

### ❌ Mistake 2: Forgot to Check "Production"
- Make sure you check **Production** checkbox for each variable

### ❌ Mistake 3: Didn't Redeploy
- Environment variables only take effect after redeployment

### ❌ Mistake 4: Spaces in Values
- Make sure there are no extra spaces before/after the API key values

## 📸 Screenshot Guide:

1. **Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Click your project name
   - See "Settings" tab on top
   
2. **Environment Variables Page:**
   - Left sidebar → "Environment Variables"
   - Click "Add New"
   
3. **For Each Variable:**
   - Enter Name (e.g., `GOOGLE_API_KEY`)
   - Enter Value (paste the API key)
   - Check ✅ Production
   - Check ✅ Preview
   - Click "Save"

4. **After All 8 Variables Added:**
   - Go to "Deployments" tab
   - Find latest deployment
   - Click three dots (⋯)
   - Click "Redeploy"

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE:

After everything works, **delete the diagnostic endpoint**:

```bash
rm app/api/env-check/route.jsx
git add .
git commit -m "security: remove env-check diagnostic endpoint"
git push
```

This endpoint exposes partial API keys - only use it for debugging!

---

## 💡 Why This Happens:

- **Local development**: Uses `.env.local` file ✅
- **Vercel production**: Needs variables in dashboard ❌

Vercel **NEVER** reads your `.env.local` file. You must manually add them in the dashboard.

---

## ✅ After Fix Checklist:

- [ ] Added all 8 environment variables in Vercel
- [ ] Checked "Production" for each
- [ ] Saved each variable
- [ ] Redeployed the project
- [ ] Visited `/api/env-check` - all show values
- [ ] Tested chat - works ✅
- [ ] Tested image upload - works ✅
- [ ] Deleted `/api/env-check/route.jsx` (security)

---

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

1. **Double-check variable names** - exact spelling matters
2. **Check Vercel deployment logs** - look for errors
3. **Try manual redeploy** - sometimes cache issues occur
4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** - deployment takes time
5. **Clear browser cache** - Ctrl+Shift+R

**Your code is perfect! It's just a configuration issue.** 🎯
