- ‚ùå "MONGODB_URI environment variable is not set" = Add env var
- ‚ùå "Authentication failed" = Check password
- ‚ùå "Network timeout" = Check Network Access in MongoDB

## üöÄ Test Deployment

Once everything is set up:
1. Visit: https://av9assist.vercel.app
2. Enter email: `test@example.com`
3. Should see success message ‚úÖ
4. Check MongoDB Atlas ‚Üí **Browse Collections** ‚Üí should see the user!

## üí° Still Not Working?

**Option 1: Test locally first**
```bash
npm run dev
```
If it works locally but not on Vercel, it's an environment variable issue.

**Option 2: Check MongoDB Atlas**
- Database ‚Üí Browse Collections ‚Üí av9assist ‚Üí users
- Should see registered users here

**Option 3: Try a fresh deployment**
- Vercel ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Redeploy (force rebuild)

## üÜò Emergency Fallback

If MongoDB is still having issues, we can switch to:
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL, very easy)
- **Firebase Firestore** (NoSQL, instant setup)
- **Upstash Redis** (simplest option)

Let me know which you prefer!
