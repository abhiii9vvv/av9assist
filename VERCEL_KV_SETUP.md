# 🚀 Setting Up Vercel KV Database

## Problem
The current file-based system (`users.json`) **doesn't work on Vercel** because:
- Vercel uses serverless functions (stateless)
- File writes don't persist between requests
- Each API call runs in an isolated container

## Solution: Vercel KV (Redis)
✅ **FREE** tier available (256 MB storage, 30,000 commands/day)
✅ **Instant** - No setup time
✅ **Built for Vercel** - Perfect integration
✅ **Persistent** - Data never lost

---

## 📋 Setup Steps

### 1. Install Vercel KV Package
```bash
npm install @vercel/kv
```

### 2. Create KV Database on Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: **av9assist**
3. Click **Storage** tab
4. Click **Create Database**
5. Select **KV** (Redis)
6. Name it: `av9assist-users`
7. Select region: **Closest to you**
8. Click **Create**

### 3. Environment Variables (Auto-configured)

Vercel automatically adds these to your project:
```
KV_REST_API_URL
KV_REST_API_TOKEN
KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN
KV_URL
```

**No manual setup needed!** ✨

### 4. Replace the API File

**Backup first:**
```bash
# In your project directory
mv app/api/users/route.jsx app/api/users/route-old.jsx
mv app/api/users/route-new.jsx app/api/users/route.jsx
```

### 5. Deploy to Vercel

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Switch to Vercel KV database for user storage"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will auto-deploy! 🚀

### 6. Test It

1. Visit your site: https://av9assist.vercel.app
2. Enter a test email
3. Check admin dashboard - user should appear!
4. Check email - welcome email should arrive!

## 🔍 Verify It's Working

### Check Vercel Logs
```bash
vercel logs
```

Look for:
- ✅ `User saved to database: email@example.com (NEW)`
- 🎉 `New user registered: email@example.com - Welcome email queued`

### Check KV Dashboard
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Storage → av9assist-users
2. Click **Data Browser**
3. You should see keys like:
   - `users:list` (Set of all user emails)
   - `user:email@example.com` (Individual user data)

## 📊 Database Structure

### Keys Used:
```
users:list           → Set of all user emails
user:email@test.com  → Individual user object
```

### User Object:
```javascript
{
  email: "user@example.com",
  joinedAt: "2025-10-02T10:30:00.000Z",
  lastActive: "2025-10-02T10:30:00.000Z",
  visitCount: 1,
  emailPreferences: {
    updates: true,
    tips: true,
    engagement: true,
    daily: true
  }
}
```
